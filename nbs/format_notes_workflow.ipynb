    "As noted in the article [\"Building effective agents\" by Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents), workflows can be an effective way to use LLMs to complete complex tasks. Our experience building the first iteration of the \"note formatting\" feature, small LLMs are not capable of completing such complicated task in one step yet. Our goal in this exploration is to see if breaking down the task in multiple steps of one workflow can significantly improve realability of the system and accuracy."
