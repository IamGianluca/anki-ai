    "As noted in the article [\"Building effective agents\" by Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/research/building-effective-agents), workflows can be an effective way to use LLMs to complete complex tasks. Our experience building the first iteration of the \"note formatting\" feature shows that small LLMs cannot complete such a complicated task in one step. This notebook will break down the task into multiple steps of one workflow, which can significantly improve the system's reliability and accuracy."
