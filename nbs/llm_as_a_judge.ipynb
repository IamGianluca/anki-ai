    "     ```\n",
    "   - Single-line commands: Use inline code blocks, e.g., `command`\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Format mathematical equations properly:\n",
    "   - Wrap in LaTeX blocks: $ <equation> $\n",
    "   - Avoid double backslashes (\\\\) within LaTeX blocks\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Maintain the original note's intent and key information\n",
