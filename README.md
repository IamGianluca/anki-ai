The goal of this tool is to ease the usage of Anki, particularly the creation of new notes and adopting best practices that enhance learning.

Some of the features `anki-ai` offers:

- [ ] Create new notes from a text file or pdf
- [ ] Find duplicate notes using semantic search
- [ ] Identify missing tags
- [ ] Ensure notes are atomic, and suggest when a note should be split into multiple notes
- [ ] Fact-check notes, to ensure there are no mistakes
- [ ] Edit notes to be more concise and comply with standard format
- [ ] Suggest how existing notes could be improved, e.g., decompose a note into multiple atomic notes, creating reverse cards, adding mnemonic, etc.
