# Anki AI

The goal of this tool is to facilitate using Anki, particularly adopting best practices that facilitate learning. Additionally, it tries to ease the creation of new notes, which can be a slow process and often discourages people from adding new notes to their decks.

Some of the features `anki-ai` offers:

- [ ] Make front and back cards more concise and standardized
- [ ] Fact-check notes, to ensure there are no mistakes
- [ ] Suggest how existing notes could be improved, e.g., decompose a note into multiple atomic notes, creating reverse cards, adding mnemonic, etc.
- [ ] Create new notes starting from a text file or pdf
- [ ] Analyze cards with poor "ease", and suggest how they could be refactored to make them easier to learn
